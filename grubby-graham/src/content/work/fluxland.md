Flux.land is new kind of interactive geo-socio-spatial platform designed to increase awareness and bridge the gap between different stakeholders of urban development through a data-driven, collaborative, web-based toolkit for urban planning and decision making across the scales.


Collaboration with: [MIT Urban risk lab](https://urbanrisklab.org/), [Fadi Masoud](https://www.daniels.utoronto.ca/people/core-faculty/fadi-masoud), [Isaac Seah](https://www.isaacseah.com/) and a bunch of other people at MIT and UofT.
